# Multivariate Kernel Density Estimation using CUDA

## Introduction
This assignment covers kernel density estimation for the distribution of TGC levels in adult women. It is implemented in C++ and utilized CUDA programming to implemnet an optimized density estimate.


## Dataset
The dataset has been compiled from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), that lists triglyceride levels of adult women. [link](https://web.as.uky.edu/statistics/user/pbreheny/764-F11/data/nhanes.txt)
